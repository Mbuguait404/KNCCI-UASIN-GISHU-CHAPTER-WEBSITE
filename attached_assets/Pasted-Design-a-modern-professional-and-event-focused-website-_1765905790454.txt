Design a modern, professional, and event-focused website UI for the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI). The website should closely resemble the look, structure, and user experience of [https://softwaresummit.go.ke/](https://softwaresummit.go.ke/), but with KNCCI branding and a broader institutional, national-business feel.

  * #000000 (primary text and strong contrasts)
* Use these colors consistently across buttons, headings, dividers, icons, and highlights
